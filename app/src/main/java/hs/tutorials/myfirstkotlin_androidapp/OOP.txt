OOP - the 5 basic concepts

variables and types
control flows
functions
collections
classes and objects (including inheritance)



variable and types :
- A variable is a location in memory ( storage )
- To indicate the storage area, each variable should be given a unique name ( identifier )

Control Flows :
- Control flows allow :
    to do something conditionally
    to repeatedly run code ( conditionally )

Functions :
- Functions enable us :
    to separate code
    to run code blocks when needed

Collections
- Collections enable us to
    store multiple elements in one place
    iterate through multiple elements ( with the help of control flows )

Classes :
- Allow us to
    create our own ata types
    keep the data members and methods together in one place
    write more readable and maintainable code
    work better in a team
